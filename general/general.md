# Server Spec
1. What  is through-put / IOPS / Latency
   * Through-put: How much data the machine is able to send and recieve (in bytes)
   * IOPSï¼šIO means how many input and outputs a disk is able to read and write.(The access amount) IOPS means how many IO's the machine is able to perform in a second
   * Latency: How much time it took to delay when sending a certain content
  When you want to send and receive a large file, High through-put  will be needed. Whereas, when you have a lot of amount of files when sending the machine, you will need a high IOPS
